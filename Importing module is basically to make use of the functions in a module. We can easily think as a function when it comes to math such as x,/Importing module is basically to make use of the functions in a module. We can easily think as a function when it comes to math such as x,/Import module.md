Importing module is basically to make use of the functions in a module. We can easily think as a function when it comes to math such as x, /, +, and -. In python module, they are print(), input(), and len() functions. It can be mathematical function, random function or others. The reason why it is important is because how we import module will differ the result we get and also vice versa. We have to learn to import module really well to write and run the program that we want. It really is the basic part of python.
