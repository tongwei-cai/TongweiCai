# Chapter 1
1. The operators are +, -, *, and /. The values are 'hello', -88.8, and 5.

2. The variable is spam; the string is 'spam'. Strings always start and end with quotes.

3. The three data types introduced in this chapter are integers, floating-point numbers, and strings.

4. An expression is a combination of values and operators. All expressions evaluate (that is, reduce) to a single value.

5. An expression evaluates to a single value. A statement does not.

6. The bacon variable is set to 20. The bacon + 1 expression does not reassign the value in bacon (that would need an assignment statement: bacon = bacon + 1).

7. Both expressions evaluate to the string 'spamspamspam'.

8. Variable names cannot begin with a number.

9. The int(), float(), and str() functions will evaluate to the integer, floating-point number, and string versions of the value passed to them.

10. The expression causes an error because 99 is an integer, and only strings can be concatenated to other strings with the + operator. The correct way is I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'.

# Chapter 2
1. True and False, using capital T and F, with the rest of the word in lowercase

2. and, or, and not

3. True and True is True.

   True and False is False.

   False and True is False.

   False and False is False.

   True or True is True.

   True or False is True.

   False or True is True.

   False or False is False.

   not True is False.

   not False is True.

4. False

   False

   True

   False

   False

   True

5. ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=

6. == is the equal to operator that compares two values and evaluates to a Boolean, while = is the assignment operator that stores a value in a variable.

7. A condition is an expression used in a flow control statement that evaluates to a Boolean value.

8. The three blocks are everything inside the if statement and the lines print('bacon') and print('ham').

9.

10. Press CTRL-C to stop a program stuck in an infinite loop.

11. The break statement will move the execution outside and just after a loop. The continue statement will move the execution to the start of the loop.

12. They all do the same thing. The range(10) call ranges from 0 up to (but not including) 10, range(0, 10) explicitly tells the loop to start at 0, and range(0, 10, 1) explicitly tells the loop to increase the variable by 1 on each iteration.

13.

14. This function can be called with spam.bacon()
